    A factory function that returns an rpc API instance. The given

    API version to instantiate and return.

    :param int protocol_version: The protocol version that the returned
        API instance must support.
    :param host: The message host.
    :param process_manager: A process manager. This is only used by the
        protocol verion 1 API, but provided to all APIs for the sake of
        consistency.

        This key is provided by the autobahn libary's ConnectionRequest
        object at the time a new WSS connection is made.

    :returns: An RPC API instance appropriate for the given protocol
        version.
